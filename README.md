# Project_Euler
This is an attempt at solving the problems in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). They're described as "a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.". Being a mathematician myself, I thought it would be interesting to use these problems as fun brain teasers while also improving my Python. I can't guarantee that I will be right, but I will talk through my logic and give multiple solutions where I can to corroborate them.

You'll also find I use "I" and "we" a lot and interchangeably. I do that out of habit and collaborative problem solving in classrooms. Hopefully it doesn't make this too annoying to read.
